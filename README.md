# ReliefAppTest-backend

Project made with NodeJS 14.16.1

**Backend part** of _ReliefAppTest_ project

I voluntarily left the access to my mongoose database in app.js line 11 :
'mongodb+srv://martin:relief@cluster0.62yuy.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

I also voluntarily emptied the database in order to get a blank one so that you can perform your tests.
